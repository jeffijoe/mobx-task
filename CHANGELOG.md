# Changelog

## 3.0.1

* Fix sourcemaps again
* Move from Travis to GitHub Actions for CI
* Move from tslint to eslint for linting
* Upgrade packages

## 3.0.0

* **Breaking**: Stacking the `@task` decorator with MobX `@action` no longer works in MobX v6. Instead, the task itself was made an action by default. This was done to escape the MobX auto-action behavior.
* **Breaking**: TypeScript target updated to `es6`.
* Add MobX v6 support.
* Upgrade all dependencies.

## 2.0.1

- Fix sourcemaps content.

## 2.0.0

- TypeScript definitions for public API based on the DefinitelyTyped ones.
- Ported codebase to basic TypeScript. A lot of exotic things going on, so definitely not idiomatic.
- Added `TaskGroup` for combining task result reactions into a single state.

## 1.0.4

- Add name argument for `setState` action ([#18](https://github.com/jeffijoe/mobx-task/pull/18) by [@cyclops26](https://github.com/cyclops26))
- Update packages

## 1.0.3

- Add support for fields using arrow functions ([#12](https://github.com/jeffijoe/mobx-task/pull/12) by [@JulianWielga](https://github.com/JulianWielga))
- Update packages

## 1.0.2

- Update packages, attempt to fix CI build

## 1.0.1

- Remove babel runtime dependency, this was a mistake.

## 1.0.0

- **Breaking**: upgrade to MobX v5. No changes made to the code, should work with MobX v4 as well, but marking as breaking just in case.
